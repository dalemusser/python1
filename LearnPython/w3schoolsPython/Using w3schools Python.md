## Using w3schools Python

This document describes how to use <https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp> interactive tutorials and documentation to learn about Python language features and programming.

On the [first page of the Python Tutorial on w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) it has "Learning by Examples."  It presents an example, ```print("Hello, World!")```, that has a green *Try it Yourself* button that allows you to run the code.
